MITE Batch 2

1. Find the minimum value in array:
required data : array
required operation: min element


2. Find the least missing element in array:
eg:
9,5,23,6,24,78,12
output: 


finding first min, second min	>> O(n)>> loop



secondmin-firstmin	>> different
	6	-	5	>> 1
secondMin+1 - different
	7	- 1	>> 6>>
